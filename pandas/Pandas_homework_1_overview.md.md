**Write 5 things what you found useful from the Kaggle Kernel**
 * For numerical variables, we can do scatter plotting
 * For categorical features, we can do box plot
 * Heatmap style gives a clear presentation about the correlation matrix 
 * In seaborn, we can draw multiple plots just in a single command 
 * How to work on missing data and draw probability plot

**Describe in 15 sentences what can be done in Pandas**

Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data analysis. We can load data as Data Frames (ususlly 2D labeled) from different file format. Working with multi-dimentional data or Data Frames is challenging, but in Pandas it consider it as the index(the row) and comumn.

Pandas also support data integration, reshaping, slicing, indexing, joining, merging and can also use time series functionality. Pandas is very polular to use DataFrame which is two-dimensional array with heterogeneous data. Others data types are Series (one-dimentional array) and Panel (three-dimensional data structure).

We can create series from numpy ndarray or dict or scalar by Series(). We can retireve data by using Start/Stop index, or calling the specific index from that series. We can create Data Frame by DataFrame() that supports inputs such as Lists, dict, Series, Numpy ndarrays or another DataFrame. We can read/write to CSV, Excel, SQL Query and also in Database table as well. We can also manipulate tha data by drop(drop()), sort(order()) or rank(rank()). From the DataFrame we can retrieve information such as shape, index, comumns, info, count, sum, mean and so on. Reshaping of the data can be done by melt,concat or pivit. We can also plot histogram and scatter chart.
